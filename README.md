# flutter_bloc_task_1

Task for newbies in Flutter

## Task

Use files in repo to make list of posts from this [link](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts).

Use [http](https://pub.dev/packages/http) package to get posts.

Use [flutter_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) to to achieve this. Do not forget to add initial, loading, loaded and error states.

Use [json_serializable](https://pub.dev/packages/json_serializable) and [json_annotation](https://pub.dev/packages/json_annotation) to serialize the data.

Feel free to add files and folders if you need it.

All needed packages already installed in repo. All widgets that you need already in repo. You just need to add get request and add bloc to handle states.

That's it, good luck!
